|The object of the game is to determine who is the   |
|sleeper cell in the central united states.          |
|Read all of the suspect bios carefully, as they may |
|be tricky.                                          |
|You only have 5 chances to look at information, but |
|you get a freebee at the beginning of the game when |
|it shows you the intel.  You may look at the intel  |
|again, but it may be unwise, as there are 5 suspects|
|and it takes a turn per suspect bio you view, and a |
|turn per time you view the intel.                   |
|                                                    |
|When you feel that you have enough information,     |
|make a guess.                                       |
|If you guess correctly, your scores are stored in   |
|the scores.txt                                      |
|Good luck.                                          |
